# Air-Quality-in-Dar-es-salaam


# Overview 
In this project, we worked with data from one of Africa's largest open data platforms [openAfrica](https://africaopendata.org/). We looked at air quality data from Dar es Salaam, Tanzania; and built a time series model to predict PM 2.5 readings throughout the day.
